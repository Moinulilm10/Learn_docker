# Kubernetes Study Notes

## What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes** is an **open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications**. In simple terms, it’s a tool that helps you run and automate applications packaged inside containers (like Docker), especially when you want to run them on multiple computers (called a _cluster_). Kubernetes makes complex tasks like scaling your application, distributing incoming traffic (load balancing), and restarting crashed applications automatic and much easier.

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine you run an Airbnb with several rooms and lots of different guests coming and going. You hire a manager to ensure there are always enough clean rooms available, to hand out keys, and to manage the staff. Your job? Simply say how many rooms should always be ready and the manager (Kubernetes) handles everything automatically: cleaning, key handoff, staff replacements, and even adding more rooms if there are more guests than usual.

Another analogy: Think of Kubernetes as a **theme park manager** ensuring all rides (apps) run smoothly, are always staffed, and replace rides that break, even adding new ones when more visitors arrive.

## Why Do You Need Kubernetes?

- **Manually running containers is hard.** You don’t want to monitor every app, restart crashed apps, or launch more when the website gets busy.
- **Automatic scaling:** Kubernetes adds more containers when needed, and shuts them down when no longer required.
- **Load balancing:** Incoming requests are evenly distributed so no server is overwhelmed.
- **Self-healing:** If something crashes, Kubernetes restarts it automatically.
- **Portability:** With Kubernetes, you avoid vendor lock-in by creating configs that work anywhere (cloud, hybrid, or on your own servers).
- **Consistency:** Helps ensure your app always runs as defined – even if some pieces fail.

## How Does Kubernetes Work?

You **describe your “desired state”** in a configuration file (e.g., “always 3 copies of my app running”). Kubernetes reads this file and makes it reality by creating, running, stopping, and monitoring your containers as _Pods_ across your machines.

This is called **orchestration**: instead of telling servers directly what to do, you declare what you want, and Kubernetes figures out how to achieve it automatically.

### Example Configuration (YAML)

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: users-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: users
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: users
          image: my-repo/users-application
```

## Kubernetes Architecture: Core Concepts

![Kubernetes architecture diagram showing Control Plane, Worker Nodes, Pods, and Containers.](https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1754743224/pplx_project_search_images/7468af5850f102f574bffa0676e86c8d46a42f68.png)

### Cluster

A **Kubernetes Cluster** is a group of machines (computers or servers), networked together, to run your containerized applications.

### Nodes

- **Master Node (Control Plane):** The “brain” that manages your cluster.
- **Worker Nodes:** Where your applications (containers) actually run.

### Core Components

## Key Concepts Explained

### **Pod**

- Smallest unit you manage in Kubernetes.
- Wraps one or more containers, often sharing storage and network resources.
- Think of a Pod as a hotel room, and the containers are the beds inside it. Each room (Pod) can have one or more beds (containers), and everything in the room (IP address, storage) is shared.

![Kubernetes Pod vs. Container: Two containers in a pod sharing the volume.](https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1755509995/pplx_project_search_images/7ba32ada71b300343b81ac6d6653885074ef4615.png)

### **Deployment**

- A higher-level resource that manages Pods.
- Specifies how many copies (replicas) must always run, and handles updates and rollbacks.
- Example: If you want three copies of your app always running, you define a Deployment; Kubernetes will automatically create, replace, and monitor the Pods as needed.

### **Service**

- Provides a stable “endpoint” to access your Pods.
- Handles internal load balancing so even if Pods are replaced or their addresses change, traffic is reliably routed.

### Kubernetes in Action

Analogy: If a hotel room (Pod) is unavailable, the hotel manager (Kubernetes Deployment) ensures a new one is made ready so there are always enough rooms for guests (users). A receptionist (Service) makes sure guests always find the correct room regardless of room number changes.

## Real-World Analogies to Remember

- **Shipping Manager:** You have packages (containers) ready to ship, but instead of handling logistics directly, Kubernetes (the manager) schedules deliveries, adds more trucks when needed, and keeps everything running smoothly.
- **Restaurant Kitchen:** Kubernetes is the head chef, making sure all menu items (containers) are prepared on time, stations (worker nodes) are staffed, and meals are served (your app runs well).
- **Taxi Service:** You tell the dispatcher (Kubernetes) how many taxis (app replicas) should be available; if one breaks down, another is dispatched automatically.

## Interview Questions (With Simple Answers)

| Question                                          | Example Answer                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **What is Kubernetes?**                           | An open-source system that automates deploying, scaling, and managing containerized apps.                                            |
| **What is a Pod?**                                | The smallest unit in Kubernetes, a wrapper for one or more containers with shared resources.                                         |
| **Difference between Pod and Container?**         | Pod is a Kubernetes concept; it can hold multiple containers that share network/storage. A container is just a packaged application. |
| **Difference between Deployment and Pod?**        | Deployment manages the desired state for Pods (like how many should run, when to update), Pods do the actual running of containers.  |
| **What is container orchestration?**              | Automating deployment, scaling, and management of containers across a cluster.                                                       |
| **What is the role of the kubelet?**              | It runs on Worker Nodes and ensures containers are running as expected, based on defined specifications.                             |
| **How does Kubernetes help with scaling?**        | It automatically adds/removes Pods as needed (auto-scaling), without manual intervention.                                            |
| **What happens if a container crashes?**          | Kubernetes restarts it automatically to maintain the desired state.                                                                  |
| **What does “desired state” mean in Kubernetes?** | The state you define by configuration (how many apps, which version, etc.)—Kubernetes strives to make the actual state match it.     |
| **What is a Service in Kubernetes?**              | An abstraction that exposes Pods via a stable endpoint and manages internal/external traffic.                                        |

| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Cluster    | Theme park/hotel       | All the machines working together           |
| Node       | Hotel floor/kitchen    | Individual machine in the cluster           |
| Pod        | Hotel room             | Smallest deployable unit (holds containers) |
| Container  | Bed in hotel room      | Actual app or microservice                  |
| Deployment | Hotel manager          | Ensures right number of rooms (Pods)        |
| Service    | Receptionist/Frontdesk | Ensures guests find the right room          |

### Additional Tips

- Focus on understanding the flow: **Desired State → Configuration → Kubernetes Handling → Actual State.**
- Learn common YAML configs for Deployments and Services.
- Practice explaining analogies. Interviewers appreciate clear explanations, not just technical details.
